# QSPICE-PI-Controller

## Introduction
This project is part of a greater series of projects **QSPICE-XX-Controller** which aims to simulate in the QSPICE environment analog and discrete controllers. The arbitrary choice for QSPICE instead of more mature environments like **MATLAB/Simulink** is due to its ability to integrate with electronic passive and active devices, allowing for non-linear considerations that would be cumbersome to simulate in MATLAB for example. Thus, a more accurate description of the physical model can be achieved. 

Examples of non-linearities that could be cumbersome to simulate in other tools are: ADC/DAC distortions; effects of power supply ripple in component response; non-linear OP-AMP and transistor amplifier response. 

Although there are many problems that should be tackled for an accurate digital twin this specific project aims a **simple simulation of a PI controller of a given plant**, mapping the problems and solutions necessary to replicate a digital controller project simulated in MATLAB/Simulink. 

The proposed simulation system is comprised of (1) a known plant $G_{P}$; (2) a digital controller $G_{C}$; (3) a Analog to Digital Converter $G_{ADC}$; (4) a Digital do Analog Converter $G_{DAC}$; and (5) a subtraction block, by which the desired reference $r(k)$ given by $R_{GEN}$ is compared to the measured output $y(k)$ and a error signal $e(k)$ is computed and sent to the input of the controller.

As can be seen by the usage of both ADC and DAC blocks, the controller will be designed in the discrete Z-Domain. The overall project for the PI controller was done in the steps identified below:
1. Description & Analysis of the Control System
2. Statement of the goal statistics for the Closed Loop System response in the S-Domain
3. Transformation of the SLIT System to the Z-Domain
4. Definition of the controller equation $G_c$ via the Root Locus Method
5. Implementation of the controller in QSPICE
6. Manual optimization of the controller

Initialy, the choosen problem was taken from the Youtube channel [CAN Education](https://www.youtube.com/@CanBijles), in the [Digital Control Design | PI Controller Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MogarqbRurI&list=PLuUNUe8EVqln8g-yPt_2ZEtjH8Faegm3S&index=2) video. Although this is far from being the only content on Youtube that has excelent control systems design lectures, it is able to reproduce step-by-step the design procedure and give quantitative data of the final results, which will be unvaluable to compare the designed system that is built here. Thus, if a more in depth approach into the mathematics is required, this channel is the reference.

With the introduction to the project done, let's delve ourselves into the initial design.

## 1. Control System Description & Analysis
As already mentioned in the introduction, the aim of this specific project is to evaluate the usage of the QSPICE simulator as a viable simulation platform for control systems simulation. Hence, the simulated plant will be (at least initially) a simple one pole stable system given by $G_P$:

$$ G_P = {1 \over (s+1)}$$

Additionally, the presence of the DAC will be accounted as a Zero-Order-Hold (ZOH) operator, wich will be accounted for mathematically in the discretization process of the target plant $G_P$ by the expression:

$$
    G_{DAC} = G_{ZOH} = {{1-e^{-sT}} \over {s}}
$$

Thus the final system that will be analysed is given in the figure below:

![System Diagram](./figs/SimpleSystemEqDiagram.png "Block Diagram of the proposed system")
<p style="text-align: center;">Fig. 2 - System Block Diagram w\ Equations</p>

## 2. Key Controller Parameters
Another assumption that will be done is relative to the performance statistics of the closed loop system response. With the Root Locus Method in mind, the core performance metric shall be:

1. [$t_s(2\%)$   ] : Settling Time (2%) less than **24 seconds**  
2. [$e_{SS}$    ] : Steady-State error equal to **zero for a step input**

As stated by the title of this project, the discrete digital controller will be a PI controller, thus it is expected that it's characteristic equation is given by a proportional term $K_P$ and a integral term $K_I$ (which will be discussed later), thus, there is no need for more performance related values such as the Peak Overshoot value $M_p$ or the Rise Time $t_R$. 

The only other key parameter that needs to be disclosed is the sampling time $T_s$ which will be equal to 0.5 seconds in this initial example.

## 3. Sample-Hold & Plant Transfer Function
To be able to use de Root Locus Method of designning the discrete controller first, both the zero order hold and the target plant should have their transfer functions discretized. Let $G(s)$ be the union of the hold and plant transfer functions, then:
$$
G(s) = G_h(s) \cdot G_p(s) = {{1-e^{-sT_s}}\over{s}} \cdot {{1}\over{s+1}} = {(1-e^{-sT_s})} \cdot {{1}\over{s(s+1)}}
$$

with the help of pre-computed tables such as [this one](https://lpsa.swarthmore.edu/LaplaceZTable/LaplaceZFuncTable.html) the impulse Z-Transform of $G(s)$ can be determined as

$$
G(z)=\Zeta\{G(s)\}=\Zeta\{{(1-e^{-sT_s})} \cdot {{1}\over{s(s+1)}}\}=\Zeta\{{(1-e^{-sT_s})}\} \cdot \Zeta\{{{1}\over{s(s+1)}}\}
$$
$$
\therefore G(z)=(1-z^{-1}) \cdot {{(1-e^{-1 \cdot 0.5})z} \over {(z-1)\cdot(z-e^{-1 \cdot 0.5})}} = {{1-e^{-0.5}}\over{(z-e^{-0.5})}} \therefore G(z)={{0.3935} \over {z-0.6065}}
$$

## 4. Discrete Controller Design via Root Locus Method
It is know that in the Laplace Domain, the design point of the controller is given by $s_m=-\sigma_{d} + j\omega_d$. The two variables ($\sigma_d$ and $\omega_d$) can be determined via the goal performance metrics. The real part $\sigma_d$ can be solved using the specified settling time, where:

$$
    t_s(2\%) = {4 \over \sigma_d} \space \rightarrow \space \sigma_d = {1 \over 6} 
$$

While the imaginary part could be accounted for if the peak value or any other key performance metric is given, it is not the case for this example (again simplicity is best for preliminary tests) and thus, it's value will be zero:

$$
    \omega_d = 0 \therefore s_m = -{1 \over 6}
$$

To convert the design point from the S-Domain to the Z-Domain, we will use the exact transformation, defined as:

$$
    z = {e^{sT}} \therefore z_m = e^{s_mT_s} = e^{-{1 \over 6} \cdot {0.5}} \therefore z_m = 0.9200
$$

With the definition of the design point in the Z-Domain, the discrete controller can be designed by using the same method used in the continuous case. To start the design procedure, a Z transform of the standard PID ISA formulation is taken, resulting in the discrete PID controller form:

$$
    G_C(s) = {{U(s)}\over{E(s)}} = {{K_P}\cdot{(1+{1 \over T_Is}+{T_ds})}}
$$

numerous methods can be used to transform from S-to-Z plane with different characterics being implied into the resulting equations. Initially the backwards finite difference method was used due to it's simplicity. The backbone of this method is the comprehention that the derivative of a signal x with respect to time can be aproximated by the average of the backwards difference between two consecutive samples:

$$
    {{\partial} \over {\partial t}}x(t) \simeq {{x(t)-z(t-T_s)} \over {T_s}} \implies \Zeta\{{{\partial} \over {\partial t}}x(t)\} = sX(s) \simeq {1-z^{-1} \over T_s} \cdot \Zeta\{X(s)\}
$$

therefore, the PID controller can be expressed as:

$$
    {G_C(z)= \Zeta\{G_C(s)\}} = K_P + {{K_P \over T_I}\cdot {T_s \over 1-z^{-1}}} + {K_P \cdot T_d \cdot {1-z^{-1} \over T_s}} \implies G_C(z)=K_P + {{K_P \over T_I}\cdot {T_s z \over (z-1)}} + {(K_PT_d) \cdot {(z-1) \over T_sz}}
$$

As we are only interested in computing the PI controller for this given plant, the derivative terms can be null and the equation can be simplified to the following form

$$
    G_C(z)=K_1+K_2{T_sz \over z-1}
$$

To continue with our controller design via the root locus method, is will be helpfull to transform the PI controller expression into a more friendly pole/zero format.

$$
    G_C(z)={K \cdot {{z-z_i} \over {z-p_i}}}, \space where \space K = K_1 + K_2T_s \space, \space z_i={K_1 \over {K_1 + K_2T_s}} \space , \space p_i = 1
$$

As there are two unknown variables and only one equation available for the design, one of the two variables should be given a arbitrary value and the second variable could be then calculated by the root locus equation. As in the continuous controller, a good rule of thumb is to place the PI controller's zero near to it's pole, such that the negative phase contribution of the controller is insignificant. This approache is done in order to ensure that the steady state error is null (using the integrator action) and at the same time preserve the transient response parameters of the original system.

Let's assume an arbirary value is given to the controller's zero ($z_i=0.9$), then the root locus equation states that, the Loop Transfer Function should have unity gain and 180Â° phase lag so that the closed loop system can be stable. Thus:

$$
    1 + G_C(z)G_P(z) = 0 \therefore 1 + {K \cdot {{z-0.9} \over {z-1}}} \cdot {{0.3935} \over {z-0.6065}} = 0 \therefore K = -{{(z-1)(z-0.6065)} \over {0.3935 \cdot (z-0.9)}}
$$
$$
    K|_{z=z_m}=-{{(z_m-1)(z_m-0.6065)} \over {0.3935 \cdot (z_m-0.9)}}=-{{(0.92-1)(0.92-0.6065)} \over {0.3935 \cdot (0.92-0.9)}} \therefore |K|_{z=z_m}=3.187
$$

With all of the controller parameters calculated, the next step is its effective implementation within the QSPICE environment.

## 6. Controller Implementation & Testing

Although the implementation of the control law itself is fairly straight foward, this step is the most important to evaluate if the QSPICE environment can accurately reproduce the MATLAB/Simulink result. A [generic testbed](.\PI_Controller.qsch "PI_controller.qsch") was created within QSPICE to allow for easy user modifications and interactions as shown below.

![System Schematic](./figs/ControllerOverallSchematic.png "Schematic of the proposed system")
<p style="text-align: center;">Fig. 3 -  Control System Top Level Schematic Diagram</p>

Each block in the schematic above is a separate hierarchical schematic or C++ block that will be further analyzed below.

### 6.1 Subtraction Block

This description is only for completelessness, although realy unnecessary, as it is realy simple. This hierarchical schematic is composed by a simple behavioral voltage source that computes the diference between its two inputs. 

![Subtraction Block Schematic](./figs/SubtractionBlockSchematic.png "Schematic of the Subtraction Block")
<p style="text-align: center;">Fig. 4 -  Subtraction Block Schematic Diagram</p>

Most importantly, this block is only present for a complete block diagram like those common to textbooks. Functionally, this block's operation could be done within the controllers C++ code.

### 6.2 Discrete Controller Block

The discrete controller block is a hierarchical entry composed by a C++ code that will run in each iteration of the SPICE computing cycle. As such, this block could be approximated to a continuous time function. Thus, for a better emulation of a true controller, the CPU_CLK net was added, simulating a RTOS task scheduling. This distinction is very important, because the key parameter for the simulation to be as accurate as the ones done by MATLAB/Simulink lies within the time that is taken and the order in which operations occur. This caveat will be more apparent in the discussion of the results.

```C++
    //// Controller Implementation ////
    if((CLK == 1 && clk_lastest == 0))
    {
        // Get input data
        ek    = IN;
        // Apply Control Law
        uk    = (pi)*uk_1 + (K)*ek - (K*zi)*ek_1; 
        // Update variables
        OUT   = uk  ;
        ek_1  = ek  ;
        uk_1  = uk  ;
    }

    // Update ADC internal clock
    clk_lastest = CLK;
```
The expression used for the control law that was implemented here can be derived by usage of the inverse Z transform, by which $\Zeta\{X(z) \cdot z^{-n}\}=x[(k-n)T_s]$: 

$$
    G_C(z)={{U(z)}\over{E(z)}}={K \cdot {{z-z_i} \over {z-p_i}}}={K \cdot {{1-z_iz^{-1}} \over {1-p_iz^{-1}}}} \therefore U(z) \cdot ({1-p_iz^{-1}}) = E(z) \cdot K \cdot ({1-z_iz^{-1}}) 
$$
$$
    U(z)-p_iU(z)z^{-1} = KE(z)-Kz_iE(z)z^{-1} \therefore u[kT_s] - p_i \cdot u[(k-1)T_s] = K \cdot e[kT_s] - Kz_i \cdot e[(k-1)T_s]
$$
$$
    u[kT_s]  = p_i \cdot u[(k-1)T_s] + K \cdot e[kT_s] - Kz_i \cdot e[(k-1)T_s]
$$

### 6.3 ADC/DAC Block

Both the DAC and the ADC block are presented here as C++ blocks inside hierarchical schematic sheets. Within the realm of the sheet it self, various ADC/DAC characteristics can be added (**in other Github projects**) in the pursuit of better digital twins. Some examples include the usage of bipolar operation with variable voltage references, which in essence influence (directly or not) the analog reference usaed in the conversion phase; as well as more common ADC/DAC parameters such as Gain and Offset errors intrinsic to the conversion technology that is being used. Also, this type of block can be usefull for noise simulation within the discrete time operation of the controller, evaluating the controllers immunity to noise in it's measurement setup.

![DAC/ADC Block Schematic](./figs/DACBlockSchematic.png "Schematic of the DAC/ADC Block")
<p style="text-align: center;">Fig. 5 -  ADC/DAC Block Schematic Diagram</p>

In this initial example, both the ADC and DAC are ideal ones, in the sense that they present infinite common range and infinite resolution. This is done to achieve the exact same results as those present in MATLAB/Simulink simulations, with the added benefit that if one requires, one could tweak the simulations setting to be more in accordance with their selected ADC/DAC. In the final part of this project, some simulations with a range of values for both the common mode range and the resolution will be presented.

```C++
// Module evaluation code:
   // Calculate Core data
   QL    = ((2<<(RES-1)));          // Compute Quantization Levels
   LSB   = (VREF_P-VREF_M)/(QL);    // Compute LSB
   FSp   = VREF_P-LSB;              // Compute positive FS
   FSm   = VREF_M;                  // Compute negative FS
   FSR   = FSp-FSm;                 // Compute FSR
   a     = (FSp)/(FSp-GE*LSB);      // Compute Gain Error Term
   b     = a*(OE)*LSB;              // Compute Offset Error Term

   // Saturate Voltage Input
   if(IN > VREF_P){IN=VREF_P;}
   if(IN < VREF_M){IN=VREF_M;}

   // Apply DAC Linear Transfer Function
   _out = IN;

   // Saturate DAC Output
   if(_out > FSp){_out=FSp;}
   if(_out < FSm){_out=FSm;}

   // Perform Analog to Digital Conversion
   _out = (long)((_out-VREF_M)/(LSB));

   // Convert from Integer Value do double
   _out = (double)((_out*LSB)+VREF_M);

   // Update ADC output
   if((CLK == 1 && clk_lastest == 0)){OUT = _out;}

   // Update ADC internal clock
   clk_lastest = CLK;
```

As ones keen eye might reveal, this implementation of the ADC/DAC performs the usual A-to-D or D-to-A conversion with the caveat that both the output and the input are not only using double precision floats as their data type, but also both are refered to the positive and negative reference voltages.

This is not strictly necessary. One could "receive" as input a double floating point value (a analog voltage for example) and give out a integer value corresponding to the direct conversion from analog to digital values in the case of a ADC. This might better simulate a real ADC/DAC and might also be more beneficial for low end microcontrollers (such as your PICs and ATTinys) were memory is a unvaluable resource. But in this use case scenario, the conversion to integer results in some headaches in simulation, causing some discontinuities in t=0 and adding more complexity to the implementation. As already mentioned, both ADC and DAC blocks will be further developed in adjacent projects to this one, so for now the "simple" implementation it is, until these blocks are more robust.

### 6.4 Target Plant Block

In the target plant block, simple plants can be achieved via a voltage dependent voltage source and the built in Laplace functions. Simple SLIT functions can be easily achieved, but more complex systems involving delays and other non-linear functions are dificult. 

![Target Plant Block Schematic](./figs/TargetPlantBlockSchematic.png "Schematic of the Target Plant Block")
<p style="text-align: center;">Fig. 6 -  Target Plant Block Schematic Diagram</p>

## 5. Controller Performance Analysis and Manual Optimization
With all the blocks that compose the simulation explained in detail, let's move on to the results. Several batches of simulations were done to compare what should be expected by the "ideal" MATLAB/Simulink world and the "more realistic" QSPICE simulations.

The first simulation is a direct comparison of the MATLAB/Simulink results and the QSPICE results for the proposed target plant and controller settings. The overall performance of the Closed Loop System is not of importance itself, but rather it's accordance with MATLAB simulations.

![Simulation #1 MATLAB vs. QSPICE Results](./figs/TargetPlantBlockSchematic.png "Simulation #1 MATLAB vs. QSPICE Results")
<p style="text-align: center;">Fig. 7 -  Simulation #1 MATLAB vs. QSPICE Results</p>

As can be seen in the figure above



If the controllers zero equation is taken into consideration, it might be clear that as the zero value decreases, greater the ratio between the contributions of the proportional and integral terms (given somewhat by $K_1$ and $K_2$). Thus as we decrease this value, the closed loop response will be faster (and inevitably more prone to oscilations and overshooting)





using the Tustin or Bilinear Transformation ($s={2 \over T_s}\cdot{{{z-1} \over {z+1}}}$), the continuous PID controller can be discretized
